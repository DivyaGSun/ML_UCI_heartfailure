# BS845 Final Project

### Project Description

Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death globally. The World Health Organization estimates around 17.9 million lives per year are lost from various Cardiac disorders (WHO). The data that I am working with is originally from a study that focused on survival analysis of heart failure patients. Heart failure is defined by the state in which muscles of the heart fail to pump blood and with the lack of oxygen, the heart cells die. Traditional biostatistics modeling and secondary machine learning analysis on this data have been conducted with the hopes of predicting survival of patients based on features of their medical records. I will test the accuracy of various models, select important features, and test the replicability of the findings of these secondary predictive analyses especially the one conducted by Davide Chicco and Giuseppe Jurnman, and additionally create a stacked machine learning model. The importance of allowing physicians to prioritize and deliver stronger preventative care to those further at risk of heart disease is a huge motivating factor in creating accurate predictive models that can predict patient survival based on clinical records.


### Goals
1. Visualize Important Features 
2. Feature Selection using RFE
3. Model Training with Cross Validation
4. Model Selection 
5. Stacked Model Comparison

### Data Source:

The original dataset version was collected by Tanvir Ahmad, Assia Munir, Sajjad Haider Bhatti, Muhammad Aftab, and Muhammad Ali Raza (Government College University, Faisalabad, Pakistan) and made available by them on FigShare under the Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0: freedom to share and adapt the material) copyright in July 2017.

The current version of the dataset was elaborated by Davide Chicco (Krembil Research Institute, Toronto, Canada) and donated to the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository under the same Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) copyright in January 2020.
